Automation for the lifecycle of AWS Virtual Private Cloud (VPC) components.

Cloud providers provide web portals that are essentially control panels for the management of the virtual infrastructure. Although such portals are very useful, they are limited in many ways. 

Cloud providers provide a better option, the application program interface (API) or better yet, a software development kit (SDK). 

The purpose of this project is to develop an application for the management of Amazon Web Services (AWS) private virtual clouds using the Boto3 SDK.
